Intel Corp. is in talks to acquire Altera Corp., people with knowledge of the matter said, as the world’s largest chipmaker searches for growth beyond a moribund personal-computer market.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc agreed to buy BG Group Plc for about 47 billion pounds.

LinkedIn Corp. agreed to acquire online-education business Lynda.com Inc. in a deal valued at $1.5 billion.

The deal, the industry’s biggest in at least a decade, will push Shell further into producing, shipping and selling gas as the company bets China and other emerging economies switch from coal and oil to cut pollution.
