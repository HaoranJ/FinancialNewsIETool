financial crisis in the euro area scared equity markets globally, but equity investors still viewed emerging markets favorably because of the rapid growth they expected to continue.

Also, a number of these countries had higher interest rates than in the West and Japan.

This appetite, which I call zeal for yield, has been robust, and many investors went after high returns anywhere they could find them, regardless of risk.

Also, many equity investors regarded all emerging markets as largely similar.

But the weakness in most emerging equity markets that began in 2011 also was probably anticipating slowing growth there while activity in developing countries was expected to pick up.

Since 2010, growth in developing nations has fallen by three percentage points to an annual rate of 5 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.

From January 2012 through October 2013, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s indexes of leading economic indicators showed an increase of 0.8 percent for the U.S. and 1.2 percent for the euro area, but a decline of 2.4 percent for India and Indonesia, 2.6 percent for Russia and essentially no change for Brazil and South Africa; China fell 0.5 percent.

Furthermore, in May and June, the U.S. Federal Reserve started talking about tapering and then ending its $85 billion a month of security purchases.

Investors who had rushed into emerging markets stampeded out, depressing equity markets.

This was especially true of Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia, which have sizable current-account deficits and lack the cushion to offset the money outflows.

Big commodity exporters such as Brazil also have been hurt by declining commodity prices.

In their effort to curb the hot money retreat, some countries have raised interest rates, weakening their currencies and spawning inflation.

This risks further depressing growth.

In Brazil, for example, the central bank rate is 10 percent, inflation is running at 5.8 percent, and the currency lost 12.8 percent against the dollar in 2013.

Economies with robust current-account surpluses such as Taiwan and South Korea have fared much better.

And the South Korean won is one of the few emerging-market currencies to rise against the dollar.

Also, inflation has been low.

Investors have flocked to South Korean stocks recently.

From July through late December, $14.4 billion flowed in, reversing the $8.2 billion that left in the first six months of 2013.

South Korean equities aren’t cheap, trading at 16.8 times earnings over the last 12 months, but foreigners want to invest in the country’s companies, especially in the technology, retail and automobile sectors.

As noted, the South Korean economy fits between the rich countries of Europe, the U.S. and Japan and the developing countries.

Still, because of its heavy dependence on exports (56 percent of GDP), it resembles emerging markets in a world where export-led growth is no longer a winning game.

The economy’s dominance by the chaebol conglomerates (82 percent of GDP) is also more typical of developing than mature economies.

At the same time, the low inflation rate is more characteristic of developed nations.

The government’s attempt after the 1997-1998 Asian crisis to spur consumer spending to reduce foreign exposure caused household debt to explode, and it is now a troubling 135 percent of disposable personal income.

The low household saving rate, low fertility rate and aging population limit long-term growth unless productivity growth leaps or a reunion with North Korea unleashes a new wave of development.

Chronic government surpluses and low debt are advantages for South Korea, however.

So, too, are huge foreign exchange reserves built up from years of current-account surpluses.

It ranks 34th out of 177 countries for economic freedom.

Other pluses include the highly educated workforce, a robust work ethic and solid banks.

That is why South Korea should be near the top of the list for investors interested in developing/semi-developed country markets.

Jan. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly climbed to a five-month high in January as optimism about the economy and labor market improved.

The Conference Board’s index advanced to 80.7 from a revised 77.5 in December that was weaker than initially estimated, the New York-based private research group reported today.

The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a reading of 78.

More Americans than at any time since August 2008 said jobs were currently plentiful and the share of those viewing business conditions as good was the highest in more than six years.

Bigger employment gains that lead to more wage growth will help provide a further push for sentiment and drive the consumer purchases that account for almost 70 percent of the economy.

“One would expect an acceleration in spending momentum going into 2014,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy head of U.S. research and strategy at TD Securities USA LLC in New York, who projected a confidence reading of 80.2.

“You’d probably want to see these numbers being sustained over the next few months for you to believe that it will be reflected in spending habits.”

The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of 79 economists called for 78 in the consumer confidence index, little changed from an initial December reading of 78.1.

The index averaged 53.7 in the recession that ended in June 2009.

Stocks rose after the report as earnings at companies from Ford Motor Co. to Pfizer Inc. topped estimates.

The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.4 percent to 1,788.61 at 11:19 a.m. in New York.

Other Reports  Other reports today showed home prices in 20 U.S. cities rose in November by the most since February 2006 and orders for durable goods unexpectedly slumped last month.

The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index of property prices in 20 cities climbed 13.7 percent from November 2012 after a 13.6 percent increase in the year ended in October, a report from the group showed today in New York.

Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years dropped 4.3 percent, exceeding the weakest forecast of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, after a 2.6 percent gain in November that was smaller than previously reported, Commerce Department figures showed.

The Conference Board’s present conditions barometer increased to 79.1, the highest since April 2008, from 75.3.

Consumers’ assessments of current labor-market conditions improved.

The share of respondents who said jobs were hard to get eased this month to 32.6 percent from 32.9 percent.

Labor Differential  The difference between those who said jobs were hard to get and respondents who said employment opportunities were plentiful was the smallest since September 2008.

The Conference Board’s measure of consumer expectations for the next six months rose to a four-month high of 81.8 from 79 a month before.

The share of consumers who expected their incomes to increase climbed to 15.8 percent from 13.9 percent.

At the same time, the proportion of Americans who said jobs would become more plentiful in the next six months declined.

“Looking ahead six months, consumers expect the economy and their earnings to improve, but were somewhat mixed regarding the outlook for jobs,” Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement.

“All in all, confidence appears to be back on track and rising expectations suggest the economy may pick up some momentum.”

Today’s figures stood in contrast with other confidence measures.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index unexpectedly declined in January.

The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index in the week ended Jan. 19 held at a one-month low.

Retail Sales  The gain in the Conference Board’s measure follows reports that consumers were spending at the end of last year.

Retail sales rose 0.2 percent as cold weather drove Internet sales and demand for discounted winter clothing after a 0.4 percent advance in November, Commerce Department figures showed Jan. 14.

Excluding a drop in auto demand that vehicle makers also partly attributed to the bad weather, sales jumped by the most in almost a year.

“As we start the new year, I’m excited about the opportunities ahead for our country, for our customers and for Wells Fargo,” John Stumpf, chief executive officer at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo &amp; Co., said on a Jan. 14 earnings call.

“The unemployment rate has declined, GDP growth accelerated and consumer confidence is near a five-year high.”

The Conference Board’s index climbed in June to 82.1, the highest since January 2008.

At 6.7 percent in December, the jobless rate was the lowest in five years, Labor Department figures show.

Some investors this month are feeling the pinch as the stock market retreats.

The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index has declined 3.6 percent this year through yesterday.

At the same time, Americans are enjoying cheaper prices at the gas pump.

The average cost of a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.28 this weekend, down from $3.33 at the end of last year, according to data from AAA, the nation’s largest motoring organization.

To contact the reporter on this story: Katherine Peralta in Washington at  kperalta2@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Carlos Torres at  ctorres2@bloomberg.net          Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Investment banks in Russia, led by VTB Capital and Sberbank CIB, enjoyed a 9 percent jump in fees from initial public offerings last year amid signs the country’s growing consumer market is attracting investors.

Bankers in Moscow earned $38 million from IPOs in 2013, compared with $35 million in the year-earlier period, according to data compiled by Freeman &amp; Co., a New York-based consulting firm.

Fees from secondary equity deals advanced 6 percent to $63 million, the data show.

While investors have been attracted to Russia’s oil and metals markets in the past, retailers are gaining favor after companies like supermarket chain OAO Magnit advanced 65 percent last year.

Russia is forecast to be Europe’s biggest retail market by 2018 as chains expand, according to Euromonitor research.

“Historically, only about a third of Russian IPOs have made money for investors,” Erik DePoy, an equity strategist at OAO Gazprombank, said by phone today.

“But last year was the biggest year for deals since 2007 and it’s the consumer and retail names where it’s easiest for bookrunners to attract investors.”

Detsky Mir, the country’s largest retailer of children’s goods, this month selected Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. to help it sell shares.

Sberbank was second with $58 million, followed by JPMorgan with $56 million.

Gazprombank and France’s Societe Generale SA were fourth and fifth, earning $53 million and $44 million, respectively.

VTB, Sberbank and Gazprombank are all state controlled.

To contact the reporter on this story: Jason Corcoran in Moscow at  jcorcoran13@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at  fconnelly@bloomberg.net          Jan. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc., after rejecting a bid from Men’s Wearhouse Inc. last week, strengthened its acquisition-defense plan to head off moves its larger rival could make in their continuing takeover battle.

The so-called poison pill was toughened up in a few ways.

For one, the plan now is activated if someone buys 10 percent of the shares, instead of 20 percent previously.

It also can be triggered if someone gains control of such a stake using derivatives such as options, whereas before they would have actually had to own the shares.

The stronger takeover protections, which Jos. A. Bank detailed in a filing and statement today, mark the latest move in the takeover battle of men’s apparel chains that began in October when Jos. A. Bank offered $2.3 billion for Men’s Wearhouse.

The target rejected that offer and later made its own $1.54 billion proposal for Jos. A. Bank that was rebuffed on Dec. 23.

Men’s Wearhouse then said it would consider nominating directors to Jos. A. Bank’s board after its bid failed.

Jos. A. Bank said that its poison pill’s new 10 percent threshold levels “the playing field” by matching Men’s Wearhouse’s takeover defense.

Jos. A. Bank fell 0.5 percent to $54.41 at the close in New York.

The shares gained 29 percent last year.

Houston-based Men’s Wearhouse gained 0.4 percent to $50.59 and advanced 64 percent in 2013.

Men’s Wearhouse bid $55 a share for Jos. A. Bank while Jos. A. Bank offered $48 a share for its larger competitor.

Tuxedo Rental  Both companies have said that a combination of the two largest U.S. retailers of their kind would yield savings and boost profit margins.

Men’s Wearhouse also has a lucrative tuxedo-rental business that could be expanded to Jos. A Bank’s more than 600 stores.

Jos. A. Bank pounced in October at a moment of turmoil for Men’s Wearhouse after it had cut its profit forecast the previous month and removed founder George Zimmer as executive chairman over strategy disagreements in June.

Men’s Wearhouse’s last-reported annual sales of about $2.5 billion were more than twice those of Jos. A. Bank.

It also has almost double the number of stores.

To contact the reporter on this story: Matt Townsend in New York at  mtownsend9@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at  rajello@bloomberg.net          Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- South African Airways is in talks to buy a stake in Senegal Airlines as the continent’s biggest carrier seeks to counter expansion strategies at competitors Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise and Kenya Airways Ltd.

Senegal has received bids for the purchase of at least 30 percent of its national carrier from companies including South African Airways, Finance Minister Amadou Ba said in an interview.

Johannesburg-based SAA said it’s mulling a transaction after being courted by the Senegalese.

Africa’s three leading airlines have begun a contest to tap traffic beyond their home markets as the International Air Transport Association forecasts that the region’s carriers will earn money this year for the first time since 2010.

Ethiopian Air, the African No. 2, added a hub in Togo, West Africa, in 2008 and was due to open another in Malawi in the south today.

“We’ve received a few offers,” Ba said yesterday in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, adding that Air France-KLM Group, Europe’s biggest carrier and a 27 percent shareholder in Kenya Airways, the African No. 3, is “not excluded” from the talks.

“We have been approached by the Senegalese authorities and they presented an offer to us for our consideration,” SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali said in an e-mailed response to messages.

“The offer is still under consideration at this stage.”

Senegal Airlines, in which the state has a 51 percent stake, was set up in 2009 after the collapse of Air Senegal International and operated its first flight in 2011.

The government is seeking partners after boosting its holding last year to stop the carrier going bankrupt, Ba said.

FastJet, Mango  The Dakar-based airline serves 15 cities in West Africa, including most capital cities in the region, while offering services to Belgium via a code-share with Brussels Airlines, according to its website.

The fleet comprises three Airbus Group NV A320 single-aisle jets and an ATR 72 turboprop.

South African Airways had said in 2012 that Ghana was the preferred location for a West African joint venture, adding last year that an East African hub was an alternative option.

Sub-Saharan airlines are also vying for discount sales.

Kenya Airways owns 49 percent of Precision Air, the largest Tanzanian carrier, and is due to introduce new low-cost unit JamboJet this quarter after startup FastJet Plc began flying in Tanzania in 2012.

SAAA set up discount unit Mango in 2006 and has said the brand could be used in other parts of Africa.

Long-Haul Rethink  Ethiopian Airlines Chief Executive Officer Tewolde Gebre Mariam said in June that after Togo and Malawi the Addis Ababa-based carrier planned to add a hub in the Democratic Republic of Congo to secure central African transfer traffic as part of a plan “to cover the continent” and fend off competition from Mideast operators such as Emirates of Dubai.

South African Airways suffered a loss of 991 million rand ($88 million) in the year through March and is negotiating with the state about a capital injection, it said yesterday.

Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba told an earnings press conference that a request for proposals for wide-body aircraft for delivery from 2017 had been put on hold, delaying a fleet renwal plan aimed at replacing aging Airbus A340 planes with more fuel efficient A350s and Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliners.

Gigaba said the 60 billion-rand order, which SAA said in July would be for at least 23 jets, “should not just provide us with metal” and that there must be “benefits for our country” in terms of industrialization and localization.

CEO Monwabisi Kalawe, who stated last month that SAA needs billions of rand from the government and won’t break even for four to five years, said he could provide no firm date for the awarding of the fleet contract.

Ethiopian Air was one of the first 787 operators and Kenya Airways has the model on order.

South African Airways and Ethiopian Airlines are both Star Allince recruits, though Kalawe said in June he would review the benefits of membership while exploring the possibility of closer ties to SAA’s African rivals.

Nairobi-based Kenya Airways is a member of the Air France-KLM-led SkyTeam group.

Kato’s 246 Capital plans to raise about 2 billion yen ($19 million) in the next six months mostly from wealthy Japanese, he said during an interview at Bloomberg News’s Tokyo office yesterday.

The fund will focus on biotechnology and energy efficiency.

Kato, 35, struggled to get funding for Schaft even though it had some of the best humanoid robot technology in the world, which persuaded him there are other similar opportunities in Japan.

He was turned down by ten Japanese investment firms and ultimately got funding from the U.S. government.

“A slew of intelligent scientists and engineers are out there in Japan, thirsty for money to develop next-generation technologies that could make our lives easier,” said Kato.

Kato’s 246 Capital may seek to raise as much as 10 billion yen for an additional fund in the next five years.

Mountain View, California-based Google acquired seven companies for a robotics project led by Andy Rubin, former head of the Android software unit, as the world’s largest online search provider pushes beyond its roots.

The effort, which included the purchase of Tokyo-based Schaft, came after Rubin stepped down in March from Android, which he built into a leading smartphone operating system.

Hidden Technologies  Kato declined to disclose financial terms of Schaft’s sale to Google.

The startup, whose two-legged robot weighs 95 kilograms (209 pounds), won first place in a competition hosted last month by the U.S. Department of Defense’s research unit, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

Schaft was founded in May 2012 with two engineers at Tokyo University, who sought Kato’s help to produce disaster response robots after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, according to Kato.

“I want to invest in technologies hiding in Japanese college- and government-supported labs and startups,” said Kato.

“They could some day surprise big firms such as Google, like Schaft did.”

Net income was about $1.4 billion, or $1.40 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $1.38, a year earlier, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said in a statement today.

Analysts estimated $1.39 a share, the average of 27 projections compiled by Bloomberg.

Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson has been advertising the chain’s new Dollar Menu &amp; More, which has items priced at $1 and $2, to lure Americans amid falling consumer confidence.

The company, which in 2012 got 32 percent of revenue from the U.S., also is facing heightened competition as Burger King Worldwide Inc. and Wendy’s Co. sell more lower-priced sandwiches.

“They need a real improvement in the overall economy, where we get a little bit of inflation and incomes start to rise and they feel like they can raise prices a little bit,” Peter Saleh, a New York-based analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in a phone interview.

Sales at McDonald’s U.S. locations open at least 13 months fell 1.4 percent in the quarter.

Analysts estimated a drop of 0.2 percent, the average of 23 estimates from Consensus Metrix.

January comparable-store sales are expected to be unchanged globally, Thompson said in the statement.

McDonald’s rose 0.5 percent to $95.32 at the close in New York.

The shares gained 10 percent last year, while the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Restaurants Index advanced 23 percent.

Rivals’ Menus  Burger King in November announced it was selling a new barbecue rib sandwich for $1, while Wendy’s last month started selling 99-cent spicy chipotle burgers and chicken sandwiches.

McDonald’s last year didn’t advertise its McRib sandwich nationally, leaving the decision up to franchisees.

Instead, it touted new chicken wings, McWraps and coffee flavors.

“It’s just going to be tough because the competitors have gotten a lot better,” Sara Senatore, a New York-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., said in an interview.

“It would be great if they could come up with a killer product.”

Consumer confidence in the U.S. unexpectedly declined in January, a sign spending may take time to accelerate in 2014.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of sentiment fell to 80.4 from 82.5 in December.

Global Sales  McDonald’s same-store sales fell 0.1 percent globally in the quarter.

Analysts estimated a 0.5 percent increase, according to Consensus Metrix, a researcher owned by Wayne, New Jersey-based Kaul Advisory Group.

Same-store sales are considered an indicator of a company’s growth because they include only older, established locations.

To contact the reporter on this story: Leslie Patton in Chicago at  lpatton5@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at  rajello@bloomberg.net          Jan. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney Co. is close to a programming agreement that would settle litigation over Dish Network Corp.’s ad-skipping technology, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.

Disney, the world’s largest entertainment company, could receive compensation for technology, known as AutoHop, that lets Dish subscribers skip commercials in broadcast shows they have recorded, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.

Resolution of the dispute with Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite TV service, could make ad-skipping a regular feature of TV viewing, and ease the tension between Dish and other programmers.

The company is also involved in litigation with CBS Corp., Comcast Corp.’s NBC and 21st Century Fox Inc.’s Fox over the feature, which threatens to undermine the effectiveness of network ads.

Discussions to settle the ad-skipping litigation are part of wider contract talks between Burbank, California-based Disney and Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado, for future rights to programming from ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel.

An existing accord between the parties expired in September.

By agreeing to let Dish customers skip ads on ABC network programs they have recorded, Disney could receive higher monthly subscriber fees, the people said.

Broadcast networks have been asking pay-TV providers for compensation for their over-the-air programming, similar to what they get for their cable networks.

Retransmission Fees  Disney has said such fees could bring in as much as $500 million annually by 2015.

Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home lender, is shutting down its service starting Feb. 1, the company said yesterday in a statement.

Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, the nation’s largest regional lender, said its program would end Jan. 31, as did Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp.

Regions Financial Corp. announced Jan. 15 that it would discontinue its Ready Advance service this year.

Banks are abandoning these products amid intensifying scrutiny from regulators about their high costs and similarities to payday lending.

As the majority of lenders offering these services leave the market, they risk losing the potential to generate $500 million in fees as customers seek alternative forms of short-term credit, according to 2010 estimates from Aite Group LLC.

“It’s obviously regulatory pressure strong-arming them, because it’s a product that consumers like and that banks want to offer,” said Todd Zywicki, a law professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virgina, who has researched payday lending and deposit advance.

“The question is, what happens to these consumers?”

‘Few Options’  Deposit advance loans attract customers who often can’t qualify for other types of credit.

They borrow money that’s secured by their electronically deposited paycheck or qualified direct deposit, paying annualized interest rates of as much as 391 percent, according to estimates from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Typical borrowers take out 16 loans annually and spend more than half the year in debt, according to a study by the Durham, North Carolina-based Center for Responsible Lending, which has urged banks to discontinue the practice.

The OCC, which last year offered banks guidance on advance direct lending, said its main concern was  ensuring the products don’t pose “undue risk to safety and soundness.”

“We are encouraging the banks we supervise to develop new and innovative programs to meet the small-dollar credit needs of their customers in ways that do not carry the risk of creating a cycle of high-cost debt,” Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said yesterday in a statement.

Other Sources  Spokesmen for Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions, U.S. Bancorp and Fifth Third declined to comment beyond their firms’ statements.

A spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request seeking comment.

The banks exiting the business may still try to retain clients by offering them credit or prepaid cards, said Michael Flores, president of financial services consulting firm Bretton Woods Inc., who has testified before Congress on deposit advance loans.

“Without that product, there is going to be a void and there are very few options,” Flores said in an interview.

For lenders like Wells Fargo, revenue from deposit advance is “substantial because they’ve been offering the product for some time and doing a particularly effective job of marketing it,” said Ron Shevlin of Boston-based Aite Group.

Not Material  Shevlin’s 2010 analysis found that banks could generate as much as $500 million in new fees annually if advance direct loans displaced payday lending among so-called underbanked customers.

Discontinuing the service won’t have a material financial effect on Wells Fargo, the company said in its statement.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year said it would consider ways to make the practice safer for borrowers, including imposing waiting times between loans.

Consumer-interest advocacy groups have also put pressure on banks to end the practice.

Still, as banks withdraw the service, consumers may instead seek other sources of credit that could be even riskier, such as overdraft and payday loans, Zywicki said.

“People who use these products have limited choices already,” he said.

A total of 27 executives including Kookmin Bank Chief Executive Officer Lee Kun Ho and KB Kookmin Card Co.

CEO Shim Jae Oh sent resignation letters to KB Financial CEO Lim Young Rok today, the official said, asking not to be named, citing company policy.

Lim hasn’t decided whether to accept the offers, the official said.

The Financial Supervisory Service said yesterday that it began probing operations at Kookmin Bank, the nation’s largest lender, in relation to client data leaked at the card unit.

Prosecutors earlier this month indicted three people for allegedly selling information of customers at KB Kookmin Card, Lotte Card Co. and Nonghyup Bank’s card division.

The three credit card companies issued statements on their websites today expressing regret for the breaches and their CEOs bowed in apology at a briefing broadcast on the YTN cable news network.

Later today, Nonghyup Bank card division chief Sohn Kyoung Ik resigned, according to an e-mailed statement from the Seoul-based lender.

Ten of the resignation offers at KB Financial were from executives at the parent company, eight were from Kookmin Bank and nine were from KB Kookmin Card, the KB official said.

Take Responsibility  “We feel deeply guilty and ashamed for losing clients’ trust following this accident,” KB Kookmin Card CEO Shim said in the televised briefing this morning.

“We’ll take all legal and moral responsibility,” although there haven’t been any reported cases of the information being abused, Shim said.

The FSS started inspecting local units of Citigroup Inc. and Standard Chartered Plc on Jan. 17 after prosecutors last month found that their customer information was also leaked, the agency said in yesterday’s statement.

The Financial Services Commission formed a taskforce on Jan. 17 to find ways to ensure financial institutions properly protect personal data.

FSC Chairman Shin Je Yoon last week called for a meeting with heads of financial groups.

The regulator will hold top managers responsible for such incidents and will take stern action to avoid a repetition, Shin said on Jan. 14, calling the leaks a “severe crime that shakes the foundation of the financial industry.”

The three card companies whose information was leaked aren’t publicly traded.

Shares of KB Financial fell 0.1 percent to 39,050 won at the close in Seoul after declining as much as 1.8 percent.

While there’s no evidence that the leaked information has been misused, the card companies will fully compensate victims for any damage, Shin told reporters today, according to an e-mailed statement from the commission.

The regulator will consider revising rules to seek stricter punishment including fines, according to the statement.

The carmaker will issue as many as 241 million shares, including an overallotment of 23.25 million shares, for 1,120 yen each and use the proceeds to buy back preferred stock held by companies that rescued the Tokyo-based carmaker, according to a filing yesterday.

The amount is about 6 percent more than the 241.6 billion yen target the carmaker set on Jan. 7.

The issuance is part of President Osamu Masuko’s reorganization of Mitsubishi Motors as sales recover and as the company purchases preferred stock back from affiliates such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., which extended loans to stop the automaker from collapsing a decade ago.

Mitsubishi Motors received bailouts in 2004 and 2005 as revenue slumped following the company’s admission that it covered up defects.

Mitsubishi Motors “should be included in a list of investable stocks once the equity offering is finished and dividends are paid at the end of this fiscal year,” Koji Endo, senior analyst at Advanced Research Japan in Tokyo, wrote in a report dated Jan. 17.

“The Mitsubishi group, mainly Mitsubishi Heavy Industry and Mitsubishi Corporation, have expressed their intention to continue supporting Mitsubishi Motors, which is certainly one of the benefits.”

Share Performance  The automaker’s shares climbed 27 percent last year, underperforming the Nikkei 225 Stock Average’s 57 percent gain.

The stock fell 0.6 percent to 1,160 yen as of the close in Tokyo trading today.

The carmaker last declared a dividend in September 1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Net income will probably more than double to 100 billion yen as sales climb 16 percent to 2.11 trillion yen in the year ending March 31, Mitsubishi Motors said Dec. 20.

Bailouts in 2004 and 2005 left Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corp. with billions of dollars of preferred shares, convertible into common stock in the carmaker, that never generated any dividends.

Though independent, the companies are among the hundreds of Mitsubishi-named businesses that trace their roots to a shipping firm founded by Yataro Iwasaki in 1870, making them the oldest business collective in Japan.

The Mitsubishi companies that bailed out their car affiliate have been seeking to convert their preferred stock because the carmaker’s inability to pay dividends rendered them pointless as preferred shares don’t carry voting rights.

Mitsubishi Motors has said it plans to eliminate all outstanding preferred shares before the fiscal year ending in March.

To contact the reporter on this story: Anna Mukai in Tokyo at  amukai1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at  ycho2@bloomberg.net          Jan. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Congress’s partisan divide over tax increases is jeopardizing action on a long-term highway bill backed by industry groups, raising the risk that the U.S. will run out of money to pay for projects next year.

Groups led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the biggest business lobby, want to prevent a repeat of 2012, when proposals to fund roads, bridges and mass transit for six years sputtered over bipartisan opposition to raising the U.S. gasoline tax.

A compromise measure that used general tax revenue to keep highway construction going expires Sept. 30, and Congress’s research arm has said lawmakers can no longer delay broader action.

“Based on the performance of the Senate over the last three years, a six-year highway bill is a pretty big expectation,” Senator Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, said in an interview.

“These discussions are important to have, but I don’t have any real faith at this point that they lead in a direction that produces a long-term result on highways.”

While the legislation’s supporters and business groups point to the House’s passage of an $8.2 billion water projects bill last year as a breakthrough on infrastructure spending, that measure didn’t require a large tax increase.

Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said the same Republican opposition to tax increases that has dashed a drive for a broad deficit-reduction package shows no sign of abating.

“I think it would be difficult given the Republican view of revenue, any kind of revenue,” Levin said of the six-year measure that industries covet.

“It would be very, very hard.”

High Stakes  In July, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the U.S. Highway Trust Fund, which pays for road and bridge projects, will be insolvent by 2015 unless Congress raises the gasoline tax, bails out the fund again with general tax dollars, or eliminates most highway spending.

The balance in the highway portion of the fund as of the end of November was $9.22 billion, down 23.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the Federal Highway Administration.

The gasoline tax has stayed at 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993 and isn’t indexed to inflation.

Revenue from the levy has declined since 2007 through a combination of a lagging economy, fewer miles driven and more efficient cars.

The tax’s purchasing power has declined almost 40 percent over the past two decades, according to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

Alternative tax proposals, including one based on miles driven, have garnered little support beyond local experiments.

Gasoline Tax  The U.S. Chamber and other groups that usually support Republicans have endorsed a bill introduced in December by Representative Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, that would boost the gasoline tax by 15 cents a gallon over three years.

Former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood yesterday called for raising the tax by 10 cents a gallon and indexing it to inflation.

Noting that the last increase under President Bill Clinton helped reduce the federal deficit, he told reporters in Washington, “If that’s a way to get conservative Republicans behind it, so be it.”

Some Republican lawmakers, particularly in the House, want to move all responsibility for road projects to the states.

Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican who voted against the current highway bill, said that tax increases needed to bolster federal infrastructure also clash with election-year politics.

“I don’t think either side of the aisle wants to say that going into an election year that the last bipartisan piece of legislation that I passed was a tax increase on my constituents and those who can least afford it,” Garrett said.

Water Bill  Business groups say a longer-term measure could boost the slow-growing economy while benefiting construction companies like Caterpillar Inc.

They say the short duration of the current law has created uncertainty for companies involved in long-term projects, and also for the state and local officials who decide the terms of contracts.

Chamber President Tom Donohue yesterday said the organization will aggressively back “pro-business” candidates in Republican primaries this spring against candidates who oppose its agenda, including a long-term infrastructure bill.

Business groups last year confronted Tea Party Republicans who questioned the constitutionality of federal spending on water projects, pointing out that George Washington in 1783 extolled the benefits of boosting commercial waterways.

The $8.2 billion bill passed the House on a 417-3 vote.

‘Fatal Flaw’  They also made some inroads two years ago in the highway bill debate, said Sean O’Neill, a highway and transportation lobbyist with Associated General Contractors in Arlington, Va.

His group won support from some Republicans on the House transportation panel who initially opposed a federal role in highway projects, including Representatives James Lankford of Oklahoma and Steve Southerland of Florida.

“We’ve been focused and continue to focus on members who have come in since 2010, and educated them on the need to have a strong federal role in our transportation sector,” O’Neill said.

Representative Bill Shuster, a Pennsylvania Republican who’s chairman of the House transportation committee, sees the water bill as a model for highway legislation and will engage governors, companies, unions and others in his effort, said Jim Billimoria, his spokesman.

“It will be a wide breadth of organizations that help to spell out what they would like the bill to look like,” Billimoria said.

Shuster is being challenged in this year’s Republican primary by a Tea Party-backed candidate who has criticized his support for infrastructure spending.

Oil Tax  Unlike the water bill, which probably will see final passage by March, the highway legislation has what transportation analyst Joshua Schank calls a “fatal flaw:” the need for a tax increase of some kind.

“They may have the appetite, but that doesn’t mean that they have the ability,” said Schank, president and chief executive officer of the nonpartisan Eno Center for Transportation in Washington.

Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, proposed in September replacing the gasoline tax with a levy paid on oil at refineries.

She has said such a tax, which has been floated by research groups including Rand Corp. and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, could generate enough revenue to fund highways and mass transit for six years.

Vitter is open to some kind of revenue increase, although the two haven’t agreed on the method, said Luke Bolar, a Vitter spokesman.

Janet Kavinoky, executive director of transportation and infrastructure at the U.S. Chamber, said her group doesn’t see a viable alternative to raising the gasoline tax.

Companies belonging to the National Association of Manufacturers are open to alternatives, said Rosaria Palmieri, a top lobbyist for the trade group.

Business groups are talking about including changes in highway programs, such as faster turnaround times on contracts, that can appeal to lawmakers who want less spending and regulation, Kavinoky said.

“We’ve got to be able to make the argument through laying out policy reforms and showing the benefits of transportation that you can believe in a smaller federal role and budget discipline, but you can do that while you’re still promoting maintaining federal investment in infrastructure,” she said.

President Barack Obama, who didn’t offer a proposal in 2012 for how to pay for increased roads spending, could shape the debate if he steps in more aggressively, Palmieri said.

“There’s a big unknown in the debate: What role will the president play?”

Palmieri said.

“The arguments supporting public subsidies for automotive manufacturing are weak,” the government agency said today in a report on its website.

“Governments could better assist firms by undertaking broad-based economic and regulatory reforms and removing impediments to greater workplace flexibility.”

Australia’s car industry has suffered from an Australian dollar that surged almost 50 percent against its U.S. counterpart from 2009 to 2012, making exports uncompetitive and boosting the appeal of imports.

General Motors Co.’s Holden unit will shutter production lines in Australia in 2017, while Ford Motor Co. will close its car lines in the country in 2016.

The departures may drive out Toyota, the last remaining car-maker, and further damage a manufacturing sector that has shrunk to about 7 percent of Australia’s economy from 29 percent in 1960.

“Infrastructure stimulus programs need to demonstrate a net benefit, or else could end up being costly exercises,” Mike Woods, the Commission’s deputy chairman said in the report.

“Schemes that divert valuable labor and capital from one subsidized industry to others represent a lost opportunity for our economy.”

Funding under the Automotive Transformation Scheme for Toyota and other businesses should cease in 2020, and not be replaced with other assistance, the Commission said in the report.

The hollowing out of the nation’s auto industry has implications beyond the three companies as carmakers have about 150 suppliers that employ an estimated 42,000 people.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s government, elected in September vowing the cut taxes and ease red tape for businesses, has said it doesn’t believe in “corporate welfare” to prop up ailing companies.

Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co. and Century Securities Associates recommended the ETFs to retail customers even though brokers didn’t fully understand their features, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the brokerage industry’s self-regulator, said in a statement today.

“The complexity of leveraged and inverse exchange-traded products makes it essential for securities firms and their representatives to understand these products before recommending them to their customers,” Brad Bennett, Finra’s enforcement chief, said.

Stifel Nicolaus agreed to pay a fine of $450,000 and restitution of about $340,000 to 59 customers.

Century, which consented to a fine of $100,000, will also return $136,000 to six customers, Finra said.

Both broker-dealers, which neither admitted nor denied the allegations, are owned by St. Louis-based Stifel Financial.

“Stifel and Century are pleased to have resolved this matter,” Tim Beecher, a spokesman for the brokerages, said in a statement.

“We will continue to serve our clients consistent with their investment goals.”

To contact the reporter on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at  dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Sara Forden at  sforden@bloomberg.net          Jan. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Yamaha Motor Co., the world’s second-largest motorcycle maker, said it probably met a reduced 2013 sales target in Indonesia and expects to at least maintain the level of deliveries in its largest market this year.

Yamaha cut its 2013 sales estimate for Indonesia by 200,000 units to 2.55 million in August.

The motorcycle maker will probably also beat its forecast for unit sales in India, according to Chief Executive Officer Hiroyuki Yanagi.

Motorcycle sales are recovering in Southeast Asia’s largest economy after the government tightened restrictions on down payments for homes and vehicle loans to reduce the risks of default.

Industrywide two-wheeler deliveries slumped in 2012 before rebounding for the biggest annual gain in three years, according to Indonesia’s automotive industry association.

“Until a while ago, we were a bit conservative in our outlook, but it seems our results landed at a better level,” Yanagi, 59, said in an interview in Tokyo last week, citing preliminary sales figures.

“It’s been a year since the loan restriction program and we’ve overcome that.”

Yamaha fell 4.2 percent, its biggest drop since Aug. 20, to 1,398 yen at the close of Tokyo trading.

The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average dropped 2.5 percent.

The company, based in Iwata, Japan, may raise its internal midterm profit forecast on increased sales of more profitable models and cost reductions, he said.

Yamaha has said it plans to introduce 250 new and updated models globally through 2015.

Sluggish Outlook  Sluggish investment, weaker external demand and higher interest rates mean Indonesia’s economic growth will slow to between 5 percent and 5.5 percent this year and next, the International Monetary Fund projected in an annual assessment on Dec. 16.

The Southeast Asian nation is relying on investment to make up for flagging exports as it seeks to narrow a current-account gap that led the rupiah to be Asia’s worst performing currency in 2013.

“Considering how Indonesia’s economy is not in a situation where you can expect motorcycle sales to grow much, the fact that they’re considering even a slight increase is positive,” said Issei Takahashi, a Tokyo-based auto analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG.

“If their plan through 2015 to implement cost cuts starts appearing, and if positive impacts from new models become apparent as well, we can look forward for more later in the year.”

Yanagi said the company has established a unit to begin development of four-wheel vehicles and will come up with a “rough idea” for the project this year.

The final product will be suitable for both developed and emerging markets, he said.

The company is scheduled to report its full-year earnings on Feb. 12.

The London-based company said last week that U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans has ignored the appellate court’s earlier decision requiring him to review causation in determining which claims should be paid.

The company asked an appeals panel for immediate review while lawyers for spill victims sought a delay.

BP’s request for expedited consideration was granted in an order issued yesterday by U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Brown Clement in New Orleans.

She directed spill victims to respond to BP’s motion by Jan. 8 and both sides to file letters that day on the causation issue.

The blowout of BP’s deep-water Macondo well off the Louisiana coast in April 2010 killed 11 people and sent millions of barrels of oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico.

The accident sparked thousands of lawsuits against BP, as well as Transocean Ltd., owner of the rig that burned and sank, and Halliburton Co., which provided cement services for the well.

BP reached a settlement with most private plaintiffs in March 2012, just before a trial on liability for the incident was to begin.

BP initially valued the economic-loss settlement at $7.8 billion.

It put the cost at $9.2 billion in an Oct. 29 regulatory filing.

Spill Victims  Geoff Morrell, BP spokesman, declined to comment on Clement’s order.

David Falkenstein, a spokesman for lawyers leading the spill litigation, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

BP has been battling since the beginning of last year with Barbier, lawyers for spill victims and the administrator of the settlement, Patrick Juneau, over an interpretation of the agreement that the company says improperly allows payments to claimants who can’t link losses to the spill.

The company claims Juneau has approved millions of dollars in payments to businesses for “fictitious” economic losses that weren’t related to the worst offshore spill in U.S. history.

It appealed Barbier’s decision upholding Juneau’s interpretation and won review by the New Orleans-based appeals court in a divided opinion in October.

Barbier, in a Dec. 24 order, said BP couldn’t tie payments to direct causation under the settlement agreement.

BP brought the matter back to the appeals court Dec. 30.

“The district court has definitively refused to enforce the settlement’s causal-nexus requirement and has made clear that it will adhere to its erroneous position on causation unless this court directly tells it otherwise,” the company said in the Dec. 30 filing.

More Costly  Spill victims’ lawyers have repeatedly said BP is trying to rewrite a deal that is proving more costly than envisioned.

In the settlement, BP agreed businesses in certain geographical regions were presumed to have been harmed by the oil spill if their losses followed a specific pattern, Barbier ruled.

As part of the accord, BP agreed these claimants wouldn’t have to prove a link to the spill to recover, the judge said.

Separately, in the first criminal trial over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, former BP Plc engineer Kurt Mix yesterday asked a U.S. judge to set aside an obstruction of justice conviction, alleging jurors broke the rules during deliberations.

Tainted Deliberations  One juror allegedly tainted deliberations by telling other jurors that he or she had overheard unspecified information in a courthouse elevator that would allow the juror to convict Mix “without losing any sleep,” Joan McPhee, Mix’s lawyer, said in a filing yesterday in federal court in New Orleans.

Instead of reporting this out-of-court contact to the judge, the juror “decided to poison his/her fellow jurors with this fact,” McPhee said, which “directly injected into the jury room the idea that there existed powerful, additional proof of Mr. Mix’s guilt that had not formally been allowed into evidence but that Juror A had come to obtain.

It is difficult to imagine a more prejudicial scenario.”

Mix was convicted Dec. 18 of one count of destroying evidence sought by the U.S. in a probe of the BP oil spill.

He was acquitted of a second obstruction count.

Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mix’s allegations of juror misconduct.

The settlement is part of In Re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, 10-md-02179, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).

“We notify the police of serious incidents,” Eileen Brundtland, a spokeswoman for the authority, said by phone.

“We always consider hydrocarbon leaks as serious.”

The watchdog investigated four events at Norwegian oil and gas sites in 2013, including at two Statoil platforms, she said.

It today ordered the company to improve wells and processing plants at the North Sea Oseberg field center after a gas leak.

“Where we believe it’s relevant to look closer at causes, we investigate on an independent basis,” Brundtland said.

The Stavanger-based producer, the biggest Norwegian energy company, said as much as 32 cubic meters of processed crude leaked from the drainage system of Statfjord C last weekend.

The leak occurred below the lower deck in the night between Jan. 25 and Jan. 26.

and Statoil has started an internal probe, spokesman Morten Eek said.

“Statfjord C is shut and won’t be started again before we’ve had the system verified,” he said by phone.

“We view an oil leak into the sea as serious.”

The other platforms on the Statfjord field are operating normally and Statfjord C should resume within days, Eek said.

The Statfjord, Statfjord East and Statfjord North fields produce about 80,000 barrels of oil a day through three platforms, according to Statoil’s website.

The East and North fields are tied in to the C platform.

Statoil declined to give production figures for the individual platforms.

In 2012, an oil and gas leak at BP Plc’s Ula field in the North Sea could have caused a deadly explosion, the authority said in April, ordering the company to review maintenance.

Her stake is valued at about $750 million.

Sandberg has collected more than $300 million selling shares since the company’s 2012 initial public offering, and owns about 4.7 million stock options that began vesting last May.

The 44-year-old is one of the youngest female billionaires in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

“Did she do a billion dollars-worth of work?

I don’t know,” David Kirkpatrick, author of “The Facebook Effect,” a history of the company, said in a telephone interview.

“She had the good fortune to land in the right place where her talents could really be applauded.”

Sandberg’s rise in wealth mirrors her broadening role on the global stage.

The one-time chief of staff for former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is a donor to President Barack Obama, sits on the boards of Starbucks Corp. and Walt Disney Co., and authored the bestselling book, “Lean In.”

She was lured from Mountain View, California-based Google Inc. in 2008.

“She went to Google, moved on to go to Facebook, went to write a book, and she’ll know when to run for political office, and probably win that office,” Kirkpatrick said.

Elisabeth Diana, a Facebook spokeswoman, declined to comment on Sandberg’s net worth.

The billionaire will attend the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting this week in Davos, Switzerland.

Zuckerberg Gains  Facebook probably had a “solid” fourth quarter with advertisement revenue around $100 million above consensus, Ross Sandler, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, wrote in a research report Jan. 7.

“Engagement continues to increase broadly for FB, owing to the strong footprint in mobile,” Sandler said in the report.

He has a “buy” rating on the company.

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s 29-year-old CEO, sold more than $2 billion in stock last month and donated another $1 billion to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.

The world’s 23rd-richest person added $12.4 billion to his net worth in 2013, according to the Bloomberg ranking.

To contact the reporter on this story: David De Jong in New York at  ddejong3@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Peter Newcomb at  pnewcomb2@bloomberg.net          Jan. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Greek bank deposits rose 1.1 percent in 2013, the first annual increase since Greece triggered the euro area debt crisis in 2009.

Deposits rose to 163.3 billion euros ($222 billion) in December, from 161 billion euros in November and 161.5 billion euros a year earlier, the Bank of Greece said in a statement on its website today.

Deposits are 31 percent below their peak of 237.8 billion euros in September 2009.

“There’s been a slight increase in confidence, and some people have returned their money,” said Tassos Anastasatos, an economist at Eurobank Ergasias SA in Athens.

“However, I wouldn’t expect the kind of outflows since the beginning of the crisis to return unless the climate really improves, and that requires that we go on to a new deal for debt relief and the economy goes onto a path of sustainable growth.”
