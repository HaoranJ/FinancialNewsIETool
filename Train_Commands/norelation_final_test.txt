Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. units along with other underwriters of IndyMac Bancorp Inc. mortgage-backed securities have shown good cause to win approval of a $340 million settlement with investors, said a U.S. judge who set a February hearing on the accord.  
Investors including Wyoming Retirement System and the Wyoming state treasurer this month notified U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan that they reached a settlement with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., JPMorgan Securities LLC, Credit Suisse Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley, RBS Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC.  
The pension funds also told the judge on Sept. 11 they reached a separate agreement to voluntarily dismiss claims against the only other defendant in the case, IndyMac MBS Inc., a unit of the housing lender that failed at the height of the financial crisis.   
Because IndyMac has “no ongoing business or income, little to no assets and no applicable insurance,” any ruling in favor of the funds “would be uncollectable,” the pension funds said in the filing.  
Kaplan today set a Feb. 3 hearing, saying there is good cause for approving the accord, which caps five years of litigation that plaintiffs say included 14 million documents.  
IndyMac was seized by regulators in July 2008 after a run by depositors left the Pasadena, California-based company short of cash.  
IndyMac, which issued mortgages to people without verifying their income, was the second-largest U.S. bank failure on record behind Washington Mutual Inc., according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
The case is In re IndyMac Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation, 09-cv-04583, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  
China Commercial Credit Inc., a micro credit firm listed in the U.S., said about $1.1 million had been transferred without authorization from a subsidiary to the personal account of a former executive officer.  
The official, who wasn’t named, was an executive officer at the time of the transfer, China Commercial Credit said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Sept. 12. 
The funds were to be used to increase the registered capital account of an affiliate controlled by the subsidiary Wujiang Luxiang Information Technology Consulting Co., the filing showed.  
China Commercial Credit, based in the eastern province of Jiangsu, was suspended from Nasdaq Stock Market trading on Sept. 11. 
The stock, which has tumbled 60 percent this year, will remain halted until the company has “fully satisfied” a Nasdaq request for more information, China Commercial Credit said.   
The company raised $8.9 million from selling shares in its August 2013 initial public offering at $6.50 apiece. 
The stock, which last traded at $2.98, is now valued at $36.5 million.  
Calls to the Wujiang city office and cell phone of Long Yi, China Commercial Credit’s chief financial officer and interim chief executive officer, weren’t answered. 
The cell phone of former CEO Qin Huichun was turned off.  
Qin resigned as CEO on Aug. 21, according to an SEC filing the following day that didn’t give any reason for the move. 
He also quit from the boards of subsidiaries including Wujiang Luxiang Information Technology, according to the filing.  
Canadian stocks were little-changed at a six-week low, paring an earlier loss as financial shares retreated while Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. rallied the most in five months.

The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index fell less than 0.1 percent to 15,120.54 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the lowest since Aug. 7, recovering from an earlier loss of as much as 0.8 percent. 
The index touched a record Sept. 3.   
Five of the 10 main industries in the S&P/TSX dropped today on trading volume 35 percent above the 30-day average.

The Passport is BlackBerry’s first major new device introduced globally since Chen was named CEO in November.  
China’s deepening slump is re-establishing one of the oldest relationships in global markets: the link between currencies and commodities.  
Shrinking demand from China for the raw materials of Australia, New Zealand and Canada is raising concern their economies will slow, weakening those nations’ dollars and outweighing the lure of their relatively high interest rates. 
Correlations that were lost around mid-year are being revived as currencies catch up with declines in everything from oil to dairy products.  
“You can only resist gravity for so long,” Shahab Jalinoos, the head of global foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Suisse Group AG, said by phone from New York on Sept. 24. 
“For a while, you had a kind of tango between” rates and commodities, though “ultimately, the weak commodity price story is the driver,” he said.   
Commodity currencies were supported earlier this year by the loose monetary policies of the U.S. and euro region, which have pumped unprecedented amounts of cheap cash into the world economy and encouraged traders to invest where returns are higher. 
A slide in the Bloomberg Commodity Index this week to a five-year low means there’s little to support the Aussie, New Zealand kiwi and Canadian loonie.  
The 120-day correlation between Australia’s dollar and the price of iron ore became positive last week for the first time since April, and climbed yesterday to 0.4, a six-month high. 
That’s up from as low as minus 0.8 in July, a record in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2008.  
A reading of minus 1 would mean they were moving in separate directions, while positive 1 would mean the assets moved in lockstep. 
Iron ore accounts for about half the economy of the mineral-rich state of Western Australia. 
The price when imported to China fell yesterday to a five-year low of $78.60 per dry metric ton.  
Warnings this week about the pressures on China’s economy by Finance Minister Lou Jiwei vindicated Luc De La Durantaye at CIBC Asset Management Inc. in Montreal. 
He has short positions, or bets on a decline, for the Australian and New Zealand dollars, and increased his bearish wagers on the loonie in July.  
“The market may still be in the process of revising their Chinese growth lower,” De La Durantaye, who oversees $15 billion of currencies, said by phone on Sept. 24. 
That points to “a correction in commodity prices and continued correction in commodity currencies,” he said.  
The discovery by China’s currency regulator of almost $10 billion of fraudulent trades depressed commodity prices further yesterday amid speculation supplies may increase as stockpiles tied up in financing deals come back on the market.  
China’s economy, the world’s second-largest, will grow 7.3 percent this year, according to the median forecast by analysts in a Bloomberg survey, the slowest pace in more than two decades and compared with the government’s target of 7.5 percent.  
The reasons for the decline in commodity prices stretch beyond China. Oil demand globally is growing at its slowest since 2011, while the U.S. shale boom means production outside Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is rising by the most since the 1980s, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said this month.  
The link between Norway’s krone and oil re-established itself in early August, after breaking down the prior month by the most since November.  
The correlation reached 0.6 yesterday, approaching the highest in 1 1/2 years, as the currency fell to a four-year low of 6.4641 per dollar on Sept. 18.  
The relationship between oil and Canada’s dollar was turned on its head in March, with the correlation falling to as low as minus 0.6 the next month. 
Now they’re more in line, with the figure at 0.6. 
Speculation the Federal Reserve is moving closer to raising the U.S.’s near-zero main interest rate is also weighing on commodity currencies and helping to revive the correlations.  
The Aussie and kiwi, named for the flightless bird on the NZ$1 coin, are the biggest losers the past month in a basket of nine major currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, tumbling 2.8 percent and 2.5 percent.  
A boost to U.S. borrowing costs would erode the appeal of the two nations’ assets, which is based upon them having the highest benchmark interest rates in the developed world.  
Even so, commodity prices are more important to these currencies, according to Steven Englander, the New York-based head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange strategy at Citigroup Inc., the market’s biggest trader.  
“The commodities move is too big to ignore,” Englander said by phone on Sept. 24. “It’s one thing, if it’s a moderate move, to say the central banks are a bit hawkish, it’s not going to be a big deal. 
It’s another thing if you see the world’s main locomotive of commodity purchases really slowing down in domestic demand.”  
The kiwi touched a more than one-year low of 78.69 U.S. cents today, before trading at 78.78 at 10:21 a.m. in New York, on course for its worst month since May 2013. 
Its slide has set the currency back on the same course as dairy products, New Zealand’s biggest exports, which have plunged 33 percent this year. 
That’s the biggest annual loss in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1986.  
The Australian dollar fell as low as 87.48 U.S. cents today, its weakest level in eight months, and the Canadian dollar touched C$1.1154 per U.S. dollar, the lowest in six months.  
The Aussie and kiwi, like the loonie, have lost their appeal for Steve Lee, head of the foreign-exchange group at Nuveen Asset Management LLC in Chicago. 
He said that he reduced bets on gains in the Australian and New Zealand currencies at the end of the second quarter, and began shorting Canada’s dollar in the third.  
The rates story “was very attractive, and that attracted inflows into Australia and New Zealand,” Lee said by phone on Sept. 24. “More recently things have changed. Those currencies are more vulnerable than before.”  
Hong Kong’s Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange Society was given permission to set up a precious metals vault in Shenzhen, becoming the first non-mainland bourse granted onshore commodity warehousing access.  
Local government authorities and the People’s Bank of China Shenzhen branch approved the exchange’s plan to build the 1,500-ton facility to store gold and silver in Qianhai, a special economic zone on the west of Shenzhen, according to Haywood Cheung, president of the CGSE. 
Construction will begin next year and take about 18 months, he said.  
China, which overtook India as the biggest gold user last year, is starting gold trade in the Shanghai free-trade zone this month as the country seeks to exert its influence over prices while expanding the yuan’s role in global trade.  
Foreign direct investment into China, a gauge of external confidence, slumped to a four-year low amid antitrust probes into multinational companies that have spurred a letter of complaint from the U.S.  
Inbound investment was $7.2 billion in August, down 14 percent from a year earlier, the Ministry of Commerce said today in Beijing after a 17 percent drop in July. 
It was the first back-to-back decline of more than 10 percent since 2009, based on previously reported data compiled by Bloomberg.  
U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in a missive to Vice Premier Wang Yang that China is using competition law to force companies to cut prices its consumers pay for products relying on foreign intellectual property, according to a person with knowledge of the correspondence. 
Lew said such steps might have consequences for bilateral ties, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the letter isn’t public.  
The July and August declines in FDI have “no relation” to China’s anti-monopoly measures, Shen Danyang, a Commerce Ministry spokesman, said at a briefing in Beijing today without elaborating, according to a transcript on the ministry’s website. 
China can still attract $120 billion in inbound investment in 2014, he said at a separate briefing.  
Lew’s complaint follows criticism from the main U.S. and European business lobbies in China that authorities in the world’s second-biggest economy are discriminating against non-Chinese corporations.  
Morgan Stanley was fined $280,000 for ignoring “numerous red flags” in opening an account tied to a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, a U.S. regulator said.  
The bank’s Smith Barney unit was cited for improper supervision and records violations, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said yesterday in a statement. 
The New York-based company also failed to enforce trading limits it assigned to the account and adequately respond to regulators’ requests for documents, the CFTC said.  
The accounts were used by Benjamin Wilson, the owner of SureInvestment, to continue a $35 million Ponzi scheme based in the U.K., according to the statement. 
Wilson was sentenced to seven years in prison this year after pleading guilty to charges brought by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the CFTC said.  
Morgan Stanley didn’t admit or deny the allegations, while consenting to the entry of the CFTC’s findings.  
“Morgan Stanley takes its regulatory responsibilities seriously,” Christine Jockle, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. 
“The firm fully cooperated with the CFTC’s investigation. The events described in the settlement involve a single account that traded for less than three months. CFTC did not conclude that the firm’s conduct in this matter was willful, intentional or fraudulent.”  
The rule was made final Sept. 3 as part of the Dodd-Frank Act reforms. 
It applies phased-in timetables for frequency of reporting on high quality liquid assets, tailored for banks with assets exceeding $700 billion, $250 billion, and so-called modified LCR banks with assets of $50 to $250 billion.  
The rule becomes effective Jan. 1, 2015, when the largest banks will begin a phase-in schedule that first requires a monthly calculation and reporting of LCR until June 30, 2015, and then transitions to daily frequency, according to Ceske.  
The U.S. agency that tracks vehicle safety defects didn’t recognize a pattern of air bag failures in General Motors Co. cars that would later be linked to flawed ignition switch design, congressional investigators concluded.  
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration failed to act on multiple police reports dating back to 2007 that inquired about a link between faulty ignition switches, which led cars to stall, and air bags that didn’t deploy, according to a report by a House Energy and Commerce Committee panel. 
The agency instead relied on a “generalized trend analysis” to justify a decision not to investigate further, the report said.  
After four congressional hearings that primarily focused on GM and Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra, the new report and a Senate hearing today shifts the spotlight to NHTSA and why it wasn’t able to detect a pattern in a series of crashes that claimed at least 19 lives.   “
Karen Aldana, an agency spokeswoman, said the report ignored steps GM took to hide information from NHTSA.  
The House committee’s investigators concluded that the possibility of a link between the ignition switches and air bags was raised in a February 2007 crash report filed by a Wisconsin state trooper and reviewed by NHTSA without follow-up actions.
