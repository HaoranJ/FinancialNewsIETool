R.J. Lane, identified as a California resident in his  complaint yesterday, said he placed his trust in senior tax  partner Michael Kerekes at BDO Seidman, who advised him in the  POPS strategy. Kerekes, who worked as a partner at BDO  Seidman’s Los Angeles office from 1998 to 2008, pleaded guilty  in 2009 to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and tax evasion.  “In reality, BDO, Deutsche Bank, and A&P were peddling a tax shelter that they knew was illegal and that they knew possessed no chance for profit after the subtraction of fees and costs,” R.J. Lane’s attorneys said in the complaint. A&P is the law firm Arnold & Porter LLP, which is also named as a defendant.  Bank Wrongdoing  Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest bank, admitted criminal wrongdoing in 2010 and agreed to pay $553.6 million to avoid prosecution over its participation in 15 fraudulent tax shelters, including POPS transactions. BDO, now known as BDO USA LLP, said in June 2012 it would pay $50 million to settle a charge of tax-fraud conspiracy for helping wealthy individuals evade about $1.3 billion in taxes from 1997 to 2003.  Jerry Walsh, a spokesman for BDO, and Catherine Wooters, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, didn’t immediately respond to e-mail messages yesterday after regular business hours seeking comment on the lawsuit.  James Ross Smart, an attorney for Kerekes, and Darryl Van Duch, a spokesman for Arnold & Porter, didn’t immediately respond after business hours yesterday to e-mails seeking comment on the case.  Ray Lane left Oracle with more than $1 billion in stock and stock options in mid-2000 and agreed to settle with the IRS on a tax bill that could be as much as $100 million.  “My tax advisers put me into an investment,” he said in an interview in June. “Somewhere along the way I knew these things were being questioned by the IRS.”  Ray Lane, who is also a partner emeritus at venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, didn’t immediately respond to e-mail and voice-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Lane v. Deutsche Bank AG, 2014L00039, Cook County Circuit Court, Illinois (Chicago).

First-quarter net income will be 36 cents to 44 cents a share, including restructuring costs, on sales of $2.83 billion to $3.07 billion, the Dallas-based company said yesterday in a statement. Analysts on average were projecting earnings of 44 cents and revenue of $2.96 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Texas Instruments is reducing costs in areas of lackluster growth and eliminating positions in Japan and its embedded processing unit. The company is coming off three straight years of declining sales caused by its withdrawal from the mobile-phone modem business and is implementing changes to reignite growth.   “I’m more optimistic than I have been at the start of any of the last four years,” Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said in an interview. “I’m not giddy or anything, but everything’s shaping up to be a better start to 2014.”  Texas Instruments fell 0.9 percent to the equivalent of $43.42 in German trading at 10:29 a.m. local time. The shares were little changed in extended U.S. trading after gaining less than 1 percent to $43.85 at yesterday’s close in New York. They climbed 42 percent in 2013.  The job cuts, amounting to more than 3 percent of the company’s workforce, resulted in a charge of about $80 million, including $49 million in the fourth quarter, Texas Instruments said. The move will lead to annual savings of $130 million by the end of 2014.  Sales Increase  Net income in the fourth quarter rose 94 percent to $511 million, or 46 cents a share, from $264 million, or 23 cents, in the same period a year earlier, when the company recorded costs tied to an acquisition and job cuts. Sales rose 1.6 percent to $3.03 billion. Analysts had estimated a profit of 46 cents a share on $2.99 billion of sales.  Texas Instruments’ chips are used in almost every electronic device, from parts for satellites and rockets to home appliances, making the company’s earnings an indicator for demand across much of the economy.  The global economy will expand 3.7 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund said yesterday. U.S. gross domestic product will increase 2.8 percent, while analysts on average expect sales at Texas Instruments to rise 3.4 percent this year.  “Investors are fine with at GDP growth,” said Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco.  Chief Executive Officer Rich Templeton is completing a shift to analog chips, which convert physical actions like pressing a button on a television into electronic signals. The company has ceded the market for modems in mobile phones to Qualcomm Inc.  While the move has hurt sales, the company’s diversification has shielded it from a slump in any single area, such as personal computers.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at  ianking@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at  ptam13@bloomberg.net          Jan. 14 (Bloomberg) -- The lira slumped to a record as Turkey’s current-account deficit widened to a four-month high and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called a corruption probe that’s roiled markets an “unethical coup.”  The currency weakened 0.4 percent to 2.1881 per dollar at 5:04 p.m. in Istanbul, after touching an all-time low of 2.1974 earlier. The lira has lost 1.8 percent this year, the third-most among 24 emerging-market peers after the South African rand and the Argentinian peso. Turkish 10-year bond yields rose for a second day and the Borsa Istanbul 100 Index slid 0.8 percent.  The current-account shortfall widened to $3.9 billion in November from $2.9 billion the previous month, according to a statement on the central bank’s website. While the result beat the $4.3 billion median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey, lira weakness accelerated in December amid the graft probe implicating the sons of three ministers and a bank chief, making imports more expensive.   The data “just affirms that the pace of improvement is just not moving fast enough to quickly eradicate concerns over Turkey’s key Achilles’ heel,” said Tim Ash, chief economist for emerging markets at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in London. The lira “looks set to go weaker still” until the central bank tightens monetary policy “in a more meaningful way,” he said.  Graft Probe  The currency, which has fallen to successive records since the probe came to light on Dec. 17, lost 6 percent in December, the worst month since September 2011. It fell as much as 0.9 percent to 3.0063 per euro today, an all-time low on a closing basis.  Groups backing a graft probe are seeking to damage the economy and force an interest-rate increase, Erdogan said in parliament today. Turkey’s central bank pledged on Dec. 24 to sell at least $6 billion for liras by the end of January to support the lira.  The current-account gap probably increased to 7.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2013 from 6.1 percent a year earlier, according to government projections. The deficit widened 28 percent to $56 billion during the first 11 months.

Barden at  barden@bloomberg.net; Samuel Potter at  spotter33@bloomberg.net          Jan. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the maker of Cartier jewelry, reported revenue growth for the final three months of 2013 that was short of analysts’ estimates, failing to meet predictions the worst in China had past.  Sales rose 9 percent excluding currency shifts in the fiscal third quarter, the Geneva-based maker of IWC watches said today in a statement. That’s less than the consensus for 11 percent growth and represents a slowdown from October’s 12 percent growth rate. The stock fell as much as 3.9 percent in Zurich, the steepest intraday decline in six months.  The figures squelched optimism that sales would begin to rebound a year after China began its clampdown on extravagant spending and the use of luxury goods as bribes. Richemont’s specialist watchmaker business grew at a slower rate than the first six months of the year as stores trimmed orders. Johann Rupert, the South African billionaire who controls the company, said Dec. 3 that the global economy is in a “very, very precarious” position.   “There is still destocking happening, especially in Asia, and this shows the retailers are still nervous about the outlook,” Rey Wium, an analyst at Renaissance Capital in Johannesburg, said by phone. “We thought the destocking would come to an end in the second half of 2013, but now it looks like it may only come to an end in the first half of this year. The crackdown in China is still having an impact.”  The shares traded 1.6 percent lower at 87.35 Swiss francs at 10:05 a.m. in Zurich.  Asia Bottom?  Total revenue rose 2.8 percent to 2.94 billion euros ($4 billion). Analysts had expected 3.05 billion euros, according to the average of 17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Last week, Swatch Group AG, the maker of Omega watches, reported a gain in sales in mainland China, boosting optimism that demand in China is rebounding. Richemont Chief Financial Officer Gary Saage said on a Nov. 8 webcast that while he wasn’t calling the bottom on watch sales in Asia, that “the numbers seem to be just a bit better.”  Sales in Asia Pacific rose 6 percent excluding currency shifts, Richemont said. That compares with the median estimate of 8 percent for the region. China was the only major market in that region where revenue declined.  “Compared to retail, slower growth in the wholesale channel reflected caution amongst the group’s business partners, primarily in the Asia Pacific region,” the company said.  Currency moves are putting pressure on profit, Wium said. Exchange rate shifts such as the weakening of the dollar and yen to the euro stripped 5 percentage points off nine-month sales growth.  Richemont doesn’t report third-quarter earnings. It reported a 0.7 percent drop in first-half operating profit in November.  To contact the reporter on this story: Janice Kew in Johannesburg at  jkew4@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Celeste Perri at  cperri@bloomberg.net          Jan. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Bank AG, Germany’s biggest lender, said it adjusted how it accounted for a transaction with Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA after a regulatory probe uncovered information that changed the nature of the deal.  “We adjusted the accounting in line with new facts that we were made aware of in the course of the investigation,” Deutsche Bank Chief Financial Officer Stefan Krause told reporters in Frankfurt today. He said he couldn’t elaborate because the investigation by Bafin, the German regulator, is still pending.  Krause said the new accounting treatment of the deal, a 2 billion-euro ($2.7 billion) repurchase agreement backed by Italian government bonds, won’t affect Deutsche Bank’s income statement, nor its balance sheet.   Deutsche Bank and Monte dei Paschi, Italy’s third-biggest bank, agreed in December to terminate the transaction 17 years early. The deal, dubbed Santorini, came to light a year ago, when Bloomberg News disclosed how the 2008 contracts masked Paschi’s mounting losses from regulators and investors. Santorini hid a 430 million-euro loss from an older contract with Deutsche Bank, according to Monte dei Paschi, and the bailed-out Italian lender has lost more money since then because it made a losing bet on the country’s government bonds.  A spokesman for Bafin declined to comment.  Deutsche Bank incorrectly accounted for a derivative transaction with Monte dei Paschi and provided false information to Bafin and other authorities, Welt reported on Jan. 7, citing a letter from the regulator.  German regulators were reviewing how Deutsche Bank kept the Monte dei Paschi deal and other similar repos off its own balance sheet, two people familiar with the deals said in August, a month after Bloomberg News reported the practice.  Today, Krause said its original accounting of the deal was confirmed by its auditor KPMG and by Bafin.

The collection consists of five products, such as jeans and jackets, priced from 29.95 euros ($40.60) to 39.95 euros, said Catarina Midby, head of sustainability communication at Stockholm-based H&M. The garments will go on sale in selected H&M stores and nine online markets at the end of February.  “Our aim is to use more and more of recycled material and this is a start that we hope to scale up,” Midby said in an e-mailed reply to questions.   The new denim collection contains 20 percent recycled cotton, which is the maximum amount that can be used when making new fabric without compromising the quality, she said.
Pentair acquired Tyco International Ltd.’s flow-control division in 2012.  Pentair reported earnings of $158.2 million compared with a year-earlier loss of $273.1 million that included charges from adding Tyco’s pipe and valve business.
Suntory Holdings Ltd., which last week agreed to buy Beam Inc. for $16 billion, is not in talks to acquire the Whyte & Mackay business from India’s United Spirits Ltd., said Naoko Tsuda, a company spokeswoman.  Billionaire Nobutada Saji’s whiskey and soft-drinks company denied a report by India’s CNBC TV18 network yesterday that the Osaka-based company had offered to buy Scotch whisky maker Whyte & Mackay and valued it at less than $1 billion.
Diageo Plc, the world’s biggest distiller, last year agreed to buy a controlling stake in United Spirits that would give it control of Whyte & Mackay.
The program comprises 10 cargoes of 135,000 to 135,500 tons each and 17 consignments of 85,000 to 90,000 tons.   The CPC pipeline, in which Chevron Corp. is the biggest corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude from Kazakhstan’s western fields to a terminal near Russia’s Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea. Russia owns 31 percent of the pipeline and Kazakhstan 21 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO Lukoil and a joint venture between OAO Rosneft and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are among the other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sherry Su in London at  lsu23@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephen Voss at  sev@bloomberg.net          Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Alon USA Energy Inc. will shut the crude unit at the Big Spring oil refinery in Texas at the beginning of March for work that will help increase the plant’s distillate yield, a person familiar with the schedule said.  Modifications to the crude unit are expected to take about 30 days to complete, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. The 70,000-barrel-a-day refinery is finishing repairs on the alkylation unit and plans to shut the catalytic cracker for work by the end of the month, the person said.  Blake Lewis, principal of Dallas-based Lewis Public Relations and an external spokesman for Alon, referred to the company’s last earnings call, during which Alon President Paul Eisman said the refinery would perform a maintenance turnaround in the first quarter.   Upgrades to the crude unit are expected to improve the refinery’s distillate recovery by about 2,000 barrels a day, Eisman said during the call on Nov. 8.
In October, the embassy co-hosted an event with an oil-industry group whose members include Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Dow Chemical Co. Yesterday, Doer and Baird met with both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.  ’Pragmatic Politician’  “He is an immensely pragmatic politician,” Keith Stewart, a climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace Canada, which opposes the pipeline, said of Doer. “As premier of Manitoba, being good on climate is good politics. It’s not part of the job description to be Canada’s ambassador to Washington.”  In the interview at the embassy, Doer dismissed opposition to Keystone as uninformed and driven by an “environmental industry” in Washington that has turned the controversy into a tool for fundraising. He said he promoted oil and gas development when he was premier, too.  “My view is the oil is coming from Canada now,” he said. “It’s just a question of how it gets there.”  Trains that fill a gap in transport capacity release more greenhouse gases and aren’t as safe as pipelines, Doer said. Canada is a reliable U.S. ally, and its oil will displace imports from Venezuela, which isn’t, Doer said.  With graying hair and a slightly grizzled voice, Doer, 65, has built his career, from president of the Manitoba Government Employees’ Association to chief of his nation’s most important embassy, by nurturing relationships. He employs humor, energy and a deft personal touch.  Hockey Match  He’s already planning a celebration of the U.S.-Canada gold medal hockey match he is betting will take place at the Winter Olympics in Sochi next month. If it does, it will be a replay of the game in Vancouver in 2010, which Canada won 3-2.  “Ovechkin won’t be happy,” he said. The Washington Capitals’ National Hockey League star, Alexander Ovechkin, is playing for Russia.  Paul Thomas, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, said Doer’s political skill gave Manitoba, with less than 4 percent of Canada’s total population, a national profile befitting a larger province for the 10 years he represented the liberal New Democratic Party.  “He has contextual intelligence,” Thomas said in a phone interview. “He can read situations in a very insightful way.”  When he held office, he was a member of a liberal party. Doer is now the face of Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s conservative government in Washington.  “I like to think that I tried to focus on results rather than process,” Doer said.  Built Schools  As premier, he balanced budgets as he also expanded educational opportunities by building new schools in the north and inner city of Winnipeg, Doer’s hometown, said Paul Vogt, a former top aide who is now a visiting scholar at the University of Manitoba.  Education was a priority for Doer, who left college to work as a counselor at a youth corrections facility, Vogt said. Post-secondary enrollment increased by a third during his three terms in office, he said.  “He’s a person of principle,” Vogt said. “He had a very strong sense of what brought him into politics and what he’s there to achieve.”  Doer also racked up victories on energy and environment policy. He pushed for the first wind farms and the construction of a transmission lines to sell electricity to U.S. states in the northern plains, and promoted ethanol and stricter emissions standards for automobiles.  Keystone Test  Keystone is testing his salesmanship skills.  Critics -- including supporters of President Barack Obama - - say it would deepen climate risks by promoting development of Alberta’s carbon-heavy oil sands. Obama said in a June speech on climate change that he wouldn’t back the project if it would significantly increase carbon-dioxide emissions.  A draft environmental analysis prepared for the State Department said it wouldn’t, because Alberta’s oil sands would be developed even if the pipeline didn’t go forward. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency called for a fuller review. Environmental groups also challenged the finding.  The fact that it has become a symbol by which to measure Obama’s commitment to climate change may not bode well for the project.  Canada’s Carbon  Oil sands development is Canada’s fastest-growing source of greenhouse-gas emissions.  “You have to be an incredibly good advocate to make the case that Canada is doing the right thing on climate,” said Clare Demerse, director of federal policy at the Pembina Institute, a nonprofit environmental research and advocacy group. “Clearly, Canada is not.”  Canada has “some work to do to get to our target,” Doer acknowledged, as he defended his country’s policies, noting that it had put in place rules that would lead to the end of coal-fired power generation.  Danielle Droitsch, director of Natural Resources Defense Council’s Canada Project, said the regulations will allow coal plants to operate for decades. Canada is also much less reliant on coal than the U.S., where it generates about 40 percent of electricity. In Canada, coal’s total is around 15 percent.  “Coal is the U.S.’s problem,” Droitsch said. “Tar sands is Canada’s problem.”  Governors’ Reception  In his push for Keystone, Doer has counted on relationships he developed as premier. The embassy held a reception on Feb. 23 for governors attending a National Governors Association meeting in Washington. Pointing to Alberta Premier Alison Redford, personable and unassuming, Vogt said Doer asked the group whether they wanted to get their fuel from her or Hugo Chavez, Venezuela’s president at the time who once called the U.S. an assassin. Chavez died in May.  “The Harper government has staked a lot of its reputation on getting the pipeline through,” Thomas, at the University of Manitoba, said. “I can’t think of anybody among our recent ambassadors who would be better equipped to make this happen, if it’s possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Jim Snyder in Washington at  jsnyder24@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at  jmorgan97@bloomberg.net          Jan. 27 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who got a 74 percent raise for his work in 2013, stands to reap a separate and bigger payday within months.  The bank’s board of directors, having delayed a decision for more than a year, has yet to say whether Dimon, 57, can collect 2 million stock options originally granted in 2008 and now worth about $34 million. Last week, the board increased his annual pay to $20 million from $11.5 million a year ago, when he was penalized for faulty oversight of botched derivatives bets.  After Dimon’s incentive package was created six years ago, JPMorgan grew to become the nation’s largest bank with shares outperforming the industry, and then snapped a three-year run of record profits as costs from government probes surged. The board’s decision to boost Dimon’s annual pay despite mounting legal settlements shows he probably will get the full options award, said Alan Johnson, founder of compensation-consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc.   “It’s obvious the board wanted to send a signal about what they think of him,” Johnson said. “It’d be very inconsistent to say, ‘You’re our guy, and we want to send an emphatic public message that we think very highly of you.’ And then, ‘Oh by the way, you didn’t earn this over the last five years.’”  Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment on the options award.
