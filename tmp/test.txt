U.K. homes, declined 1.9 percent, while SSE Plc, the second-biggest, dropped 2.3 percent, the most in six months.  Industry regulator Ofgem said today it plans to publish a report this month on the state of competition in the energy market. Its assessment may lead to a referral of Britain・s ：Big Six； suppliers to the Competition and Markets Authority and a possible breakup of their operations, the London-based Sunday Times reported yesterday, citing people it didn・t name.   The watchdog・s evaluation adds to speculation of an industry overhaul after Energy Secretary Ed Davey last month floated a possible breakup of Centrica・s British Gas unit and asked the regulator to investigate whether the company was profiting from excessively high tariffs.  Centrica traded at 331.5 pence at the close, while SSE was at 1,475 pence. Shares in Electricite de France SA, RWE AG, Iberdrola SA and EON SE -- making up the Big Six -- also fell.  The utilities have been criticized for raising prices faster than inflation, inflaming political debate over living costs. Prime Minister David Cameron・s government last year pledged to make it easier to switch tariffs, while the Labour opposition vowed to freeze charges should it win 2015 elections.  Joint Report  Ofgem will compile its assessment together with the CMA and the Office of Fair Trading, Howard Rhoades, a spokesman for the regulator, said today by telephone, without commenting on its potential recommendations.  ：Although we doubt Ofgem will produce any new compelling evidence that the energy sector is uncompetitive, there is immense political pressure on Ofgem to be seen to be taking action,； analysts at Liberum Capital Ltd. said in a note.  Utilities have blamed rising prices on increases in natural-gas costs, levies to pay for clean energy and regulations requiring they reduce carbon emissions. A month ago Ofgem asked them to publish prices for wholesale power as much as two years in advance to improve transparency.  Centrica today said the market in Britain is already ：intensely competitive and works in the interest of consumers.； Officials at SSE, Iberdrola・s Scottish Power, EDF and RWE declined to comment, while EON couldn・t be reached.  The potential breakup of the utilities has been supported by the U.K. Federation of Small Businesses, which said the energy market is ：broken and urgently needs fixing.；  ：Top of our concerns is the need to increase Hale Globalcompetition and to make trading transparent,； the FSB said in a letter to regulators including Ofgem and the Office of Fair Trading.

President Dilma Rousseff said yesterday that the Petrobras board that she headed in 2006 approved the $370 million purchase of a 50 percent stake in Pasadena Refining System Inc. from Astra Oil Trading NV without knowledge of a put option that in 2012 forced the company to buy the remaining stake as part of a $820.5 million legal settlement.  ：It・s an unforgivable mistake for the president to make a decision that cost taxpayers more than $1 billion,； said Antonio Imbassahy, leader of the opposition PSDB party in the lower house. ：We already have the necessary votes to install a congressional inquiry.；   Rousseff already is dealing with a series of setbacks in Congress ahead of Oct. 5 presidential elections. Last week, half of the legislators in the PMDB party, the largest in the governing coalition, said their relationship with Rousseff・s Workers・ Party was in crisis and needed to be reevaluated. The presidential press office referred to yesterday・s comments when asked about congressional inquiries.  Federal police today detained Paulo Roberto Costa, Petrobras・s former head of refining, as part of investigations into an alleged money-laundering scheme, a police department press officer said from Brasilia, confirming a report today by Veja. The detention isn・t related to the Pasadena investigation, according to a statement on the police website.  Calls to Costa・s mobile telephone went unanswered.  Shares Rally  Petrobras shares rose 4.4 percent to 13.93 reais at 2:35 p.m. in Sao Paulo amid speculation Rousseff lost support in the presidential race in an Ibope opinion poll yet to be published.  Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Maria das Gracas Foster said in May 2013 that the company didn・t plan to sell the Pasadena refinery in Texas as it wasn・t satisfied with the proposals it received for the asset. In February last year, Foster said Petrobras had created a task force to try to boost the refinery・s profitability and value.  Legislators have already invited Foster to testify in the lower house, said Jose Mendonca Filho, head of the opposition DEM party in the lower house.  Party leaders can now choose to install a new congressional inquiry or expand the scope of an existing commission investigating separate allegations of Petrobras contract irregularities with SBM Offshore NV, said Imbassahy. Petrobras said Feb.18 it・s investigating those allegations.  A press official for the Rio de Janeiro-based oil producer, who can・t be named under corporate policy, declined to comment on the Pasadena investigation or accusations.  Astra is a unit of Belgium・s Cie. Nationale a Portefeuille SA. Pasadena Refining was previously part of Baltimore-based Crown Central Petroleum Corp.

Roman, 50, received a salary of $1 million and bonus payments valued at $2.3 million, the world・s largest publicly traded hedge-fund manager said in its annual report today. Roman・s salary was unchanged from 2012, when he received no bonuses.  Roman・s cost cuts helped push London-based Man Group・s adjusted pretax profit up 8 percent to $297 million in 2013, and he also restructured management in response to client redemptions and losses posted by the firm・s biggest hedge fund, AHL Diversified. The shares gained 2.7 percent last year after plunging 73 percent from the end of 2009 through 2012.   Finance chief Jonathan Sorrell・s pay increased 42 percent to $2.6 million, according to the annual report. He received $625,000 in salary and $1.9 million of bonus payments last year. Sorrell, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker, became a Man Group director in June 2012, so his salary of $336,407 for that year only reflects about six months, the company said.  The board awarded Roman・s bonus payments based on the CEO meeting objectives such as cutting jobs, overhauling management and increasing sales of investment products, according to the annual report. The company fell short of its targets for revenue and earnings growth, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jesse Westbrook in London at  jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net  To contact the editors responsible for this story: Keith Campbell at  k.campbell@bloomberg.net Jon Menon          March 19 (Bloomberg) -- Joe Oliver, the former investment banker who has been Canada・s main spokesman on the Keystone XL pipeline, is replacing Jim Flaherty as finance minister, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said today.  Oliver ：will continue to strengthen the economy &amp; balance the budget by 2015,； Harper said in a posting on his Twitter account. Flaherty stepped down yesterday after almost eight years in the post to seek work in the private sector.  Oliver, 73, is a native of Montreal with a law degree from McGill University and an MBA from Harvard Business School. He worked as an investment banker for Merrill Lynch and Bank of Montreal, and served as executive director of the Ontario Securities Commission.   The government is trying to send a message of ：stability； to financial markets by appointing Oliver, said Yaroslav Baran, a former Harper government official who・s now a principal at lobbying and communications firm Earnscliffe Strategy Group. ：This will be a sigh of relief for Bay Street,； said Baran, referring to the hub of Canada・s financial industry.  ：Given his age, he won・t have his own agenda to realize through the finance portfolio,； he said, adding Oliver probably doesn・t have aspirations to succeed Harper as party leader.  Oliver has been a vocal advocate for TransCanada Corp.・s proposed Keystone XL pipeline project, which would transport crude from Canada・s oil sands to refiners along the Gulf Coast. In a March 12 speech in New York, he called Canada a ：21st century energy superpower； that is ：unmatched in reliability, responsibility and potential.；  Resource Potential  Unlocking the nation・s resource potential ：can have an enormously positive impact on living standards； in the world・s 11th-largest economy, he said.  ：I really believe the things we・re looking at now are pivotal to our economic future,； Oliver said in a March 14 interview in Toronto. ：That・s a really important mission to be involved in.；  He was appointed natural resources minister in 2011 after being elected for the first time in the Toronto district of Eglinton-Lawrence. Greg Rickford, the former Science and Technology Minister, replaces Oliver in the Natural Resources portfolio.  Oliver inherits a budget that is forecast to swing to surplus in the fiscal year starting April 2015. ：There are still some big decisions to be taken,； said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, in a phone interview yesterday. ：Particularly, the government has promised to cut taxes next year.；  Oliver will be a ：fine choice； as finance minister, Jim Prentice, vice chairman of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and former industry minister under Harper, said in an interview with the CTV News Network. ：Mr. Oliver is respected on Bay Street, he・s respected as a minister.；  Oliver has also been chief executive officer of the Canadian Investment Dealers Association of Canada, an industry group.

A program that offers eligible families Internet service for $9.95 monthly will be extended indefinitely, David L. Cohen, an executive vice president for Philadelphia-based Comcast, said on a conference call with reporters. The program, Internet Essentials, has enrolled 1.2 million people, Cohen said.  Cohen is to hold meetings at the Federal Communications Commission today and possibly tomorrow, said two agency officials knowledgeable about the plans who asked not to be identified because the talks aren・t public. Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, needs approval from the FCC and antitrust officials at the Justice Department for its proposed purchase of New York-based Time Warner Cable, the No. 2 carrier.   Sena Fitzmaurice, a Comcast spokeswoman, confirmed meetings at the agency this week and said they would be Cohen・s first at the FCC to discuss the acquisition, which was announced Feb. 13.  Cohen said on the conference call that his ：major job in Washington today is to talk about Internet Essentials.；  ：But when I talk to folks in Washington about the Time Warner Cable transaction I will be emphasizing, really, multiple different pieces,； he said.  Low-Cost Internet  Comcast in 2010 offered to create and sustain a program of inexpensive Internet connections for the low-income for three years. The offer came as it sought permission to buy NBC Universal, which it won in early 2011, adding to its stable a television network, movie studio and cable channels such as CNBC, MSNBC and USA Network.  The Time Warner deal would create ：appropriate scale； that enables Comcast to invest in new services, and would create a new national advertiser to increase competition in that market, Cohen said.  The deal would allow the expansion of Internet Essentials to ：millions of additional families； in markets served by Time Warner Cable in such cities as New York, Los Angeles and Dallas, Cohen said.

Newmont Mining Corp. and Barrick Gold Corp. climbed more than 2.6 percent as gold jumped. EPL Oil &amp; Gas Inc. surged 29 percent after Energy XXI (Bermuda) Ltd. agreed to buy it for $1.5 billion. Herbalife Ltd. lost 7.4 percent as it disclosed the Federal Trade Commission has started a civil probe into its practices. PulteGroup Inc. and Toll Brothers Inc. slipped after Credit Suisse Group AG downgraded the shares.  The S&amp;P 500 rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,868.20 at 4 p.m. in New York, after declining as much as 0.7 percent earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 11.17 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,340.08. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 3 percent less than the three-month average.   ：We saw a pretty healthy sell-off based on China slowdown fears and potential Russian expansion,； Walter ：Bucky； Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion at BB&amp;T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said by phone. ：The concerns of what・s going on are still on the minds of investors and they・re putting money into safe haven assets like U.S. Treasuries and gold. On the other hand, we・re seeing stocks aren・t completely out of the picture.；  The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.5 percent yesterday as commodity shares slumped with copper and oil prices amid concern over China・s economy. China announced an economic growth target of 7.5 percent last week, the weakest since 1990, and had its first onshore bond default after a solar-panel maker failed to make an interest payment.  China Data  The nation, the biggest consumer of everything from copper to soybeans, is scheduled to release industrial output data tomorrow after reports over the weekend showed the steepest drop in exports since 2009.  In a meeting with the Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk today, Barack Obama called Russia・s incursion into Crimea a violation of international law and said the U.S. stands with Ukraine to protect its sovereignty and territory.  Ukraine warned Russia is amassing troops near its border as Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk visited Washington to step up the search for financial aid. Yatsenyuk met President Barack Obama today, and addresses the United Nations Security Council in New York tomorrow. Obama called Russia・s incursion into Crimea a violation of international law and said the U.S. stands with Ukraine to protect its sovereignty and territory.  Ukraine Crisis  Russia・s takeover of Crimea, home to its Black Sea Fleet, has sparked the worst crisis with the West since the Cold War as the European Union and the U.S. try to use sanctions to force President Vladimir Putin to retreat.  ：Investors are keeping an eye on what・s happening with Ukraine and Russia,； said Christian Zogg, who manages about $540 million as head of equity and fixed income at LLB Asset Management AG in Vaduz, Liechtenstein. ：After the good fourth-quarter earnings season, the positive sentiment is slowly but surely priced in.；  About 70 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies that reported earnings for the latest quarter beat analysts・ profit estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The S&amp;P 500 has gained 1.1 percent this year, reaching a record close on March 7, after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the U.S. economy was strong enough to withstand measured reductions to the central bank・s monthly bond purchases. Three rounds of Fed stimulus have helped push the S&amp;P 500 up 176 percent from a 12-year low, as U.S. equities begin the sixth year of a bull market that started March 9, 2009.  Fed Stimulus  The Federal Open Market Committee, which meets March 18-19, has cut monthly bond buying to $65 billion from $85 billion in December. Policy makers have indicated they plan to taper by $10 billion at each meeting absent a weakening in the economy.  The Fed is trying to determine how much of recent economic cooling has been due to weather. The government・s monthly jobs report last week showed U.S. employers added more workers than estimated in February.  More than three-quarters of Americans say the bull market has had little or no effect on their financial well-being, according to a Bloomberg National Poll. Seventy-seven percent of respondents dismissed the S&amp;P 500・s gains since the financial crisis, according to the poll, taken March 7-10.

Newmont Mining increased 2.7 percent to $25.01 and Barrick Gold rose 2.6 percent to $20.34. Gold rallied 1.8 percent, advancing to the highest level in almost six months as tension in Ukraine spurred demand for a haven.  EPL Deal  EPL Oil &amp; Gas climbed 29 percent, its biggest gain on record, to $37.50. Energy XXI agreed to buy the company to become the largest public independent producer on the Gulf of Mexico shelf.  Energy XXI fell 7.8 percent to $21.54. The company has sought to grow through acquisitions and the use of horizontal drilling to help boost oil recovery. The combined entity, termed independent because it won・t have refineries, will pump 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, of which 70 percent will be crude.  Oxigene Inc. jumped 77 percent to $4.29 for its biggest gain since 2003. The pharmaceutical company said a second-phase trial showed its Zybrestat drug helped fight ovarian cancer.  PulteGroup dropped 1.3 percent to $19.67 and Toll Brothers fell 0.6 percent to $37.77. Credit Suisse analyst Dan Oppenheim cut both stocks・ ratings to neutral from outperform, citing continued weakness in demand and lower buyer traffic.

The insurer・s operating earnings of 7 cents a share for February was less than an estimate of 13 cents from Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. analyst Meyer Shields.  Shields cited weak underwriting results in personal lines for Progressive・s earnings miss in a note today and lowered his full-year earnings forecast.

March 20 (Bloomberg) -- Steve Wynn, the founder of Wynn Resorts Ltd., will have to pay for his personal residence out of his own pocket, according to a company filing.  Wynn, 72, will pay annual rent of $525,000 for his villa at the company・s namesake property in Las Vegas, an amount that was determined by a third party appraiser, the company said yesterday in its annual proxy statement. His lease was previously included as part of his compensation.  The changes reflect discussions with shareholders, according to the filing.

Wynn, who serves as chairman and chief executive officer of the company, received $19.6 million in total compensation last year, based on Securities and Exchange Commission reporting rules, a 10 percent increase from 2012.  Under the existing plan, executive compensation is tied to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The 2014 plan adds third-party recognition of the company・s quality, as well as goals related to the development of the Wynn Palace, a resort the company is building in Macau, according to the filing.  Wynn Resorts, based in Las Vegas, fell 2.3 percent to $229.01 yesterday in New York.
